## Project Information
This was a web app tool built entirely from scratch using primarily React and Node.js. The sample data is meant to represent relevant information about Northeastern University student and faculty, and the front end is meant to deliver quick analytics on this data, as well as to create, read, update, and delete records from the DB. 

To replicate the project locally, please add the MySQL database to your local using the script found in /FinalProjectDump.sql, and ensure that the credentials in /server.js match your local MySQL server.
